# laminas-code-lts

## Fork informations

This package is a fork of [laminas/laminas-code](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-code) library.

It was forked to expand the branch `4.5-lts` PHP range from `7.4 to 8.2` to `7.2 to 8.2`. This allowed the maintainer team to use this fork inside PrestaShop 8.x .
See commits https://github.com/laminas/laminas-code/commit/3dbe7f7f48a5d877e02cc70e4f58cb0e1e5cca82 and https://github.com/laminas/laminas-code/commit/7120a4cf5b49370d913c83d54d9a60383ddf6a59

PrestaShop 9 does not rely on this fork. This fork will be kept and used until PrestaShop 8 is not supported anymore.


## The upstream README

The following informations come from the README of the upstream repository https://github.com/laminas/laminas-code :

`Laminas\Code\Generator` provides facilities to generate arbitrary code using an
object-oriented interface, both to create new code as well as to update existing
code. While the current implementation is limited to generating PHP code, you
can easily extend the base class in order to provide code generation for other
tasks: JavaScript, configuration files, apache vhosts, etc.
